# Summary

# Challenge Overview:
Use the skills you learned in the driving simulation to fly a plane around obstacles in the sky. You will have to get the user’s input from the up and down arrows in order to control the plane’s pitch up and down. You will also have to make the camera follow alongside the plane so you can keep it in view.

# Challenge Outcome:
- The plane moves forward at a constant rate
- The up/down arrows tilt the nose of the plane up and down
- The camera follows along beside the plane as it flies
